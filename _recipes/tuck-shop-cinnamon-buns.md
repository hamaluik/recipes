servings: 18
ingredients:
- 2 packages instant yeast OR 1 oz Fleischmann’s fresh yeast
- "½ cup warm water"
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 cups boiling water
- 2 tsp margarine
- 2 tsp salt
- 3 tbsp sugar
- 2 cups flour
- 3 eggs
- 3½ cups flour
- "⅓ up margarine"
- 1 cup sugar
- 1½ tsp cinnamon
instructions:
- Soften yeast in ½ cup warm water with 2 tablespoons sugar. Let the mixture sit until
  the yeast is dissolved (about 10 minutes).
- In a large bowl combine 2 cups boiling water, 3 tablespoons margarine, 2 teaspoons
  salt, and 3 tablespoons sugar, let the margarine melt and the mixture cool a bit.
- Add 2 cups all-purpose flour and beat hard until very smooth and creamy (about 5
  minutes)
- Add softened yeast mixture, 3 eggs, and 3¼ cups more flour.
- Continue beating until dough is very smooth (it should be a very soft dough).
- Cover and let stand in a warm place to rise until the dough is doubled in bulk (about
  1 hour)
- While the dough is rising, in a flat pan melt ⅓ cup margarine, then set aside to
  cool.
- In a flat dish, mix 1 cup white sugar and 1½ teaspoons cinnamon.
- Turn the raised dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Let the dough set 5 to
  10 minutes to “firm up”.
- Cut the dough into pieces about the size of a orange.
- Dip each piece of dough first into the melted margarine, the coat it well in the
  cinnamon-sugar mixture.
- Stretch the dough piece until it is 4 to 5 inches long and form it into a simple
  knot.
- Place the knots side by side in a 9”x12”x2” pan (be sure the pan is 2” deep and
  allow a 3” square for each bun)
- Let the finished buns rise for about 45 minutes.
- Bake at 375 °F for 30 minutes. Should make 18 good-sized buns.
