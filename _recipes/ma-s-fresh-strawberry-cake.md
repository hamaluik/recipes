- STRAWBERRIES & CREAM FROSTING
- 1 pound fresh strawberries, stemmed
- "½ cup unsalted butter, room temperature"
- 2 oz cream cheese, room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- "½ teaspoon pure strawberry extract"
- 1 pinch salt
- 4 cups powdered sugar (sifted & measured correctly. See note.)
instructions:
- LET'S MAKE THE CAKE!
- Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease and flour 3 (9-inch) round cake pans. Set aside.
- To make the strawberry reduction, place strawberries in a blender, and blend until
  pureed. Pour the puree into a saucepan and simmer for about 20 minutes until most
  of the juice evaporates, and you have about 1/2 cup of strawberries. Set aside to
  cool.
- In a bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside
- In a large bowl, cream together butter, shortening, and sugar. Mix in eggs one at
  a time until combined. Mix in strawberry extract and vanilla extract. Stir in sour
  cream. (batter may look spotty and that is fine)
- Add the food coloring. (Cake will be a VERY pale pink if not using food coloring.
  Start with 5-6 drops and increase after you add the puree in the next step if you
  want it darker)
- Add dry ingredients into wet ingredients, alternating with the milk until the mixture
  is well combined. (Be careful not to over mix or the cake will be crumbly).
- Fold in strawberry reduction. Be sure to mix it in thoroughly so there are no streaks
  in the batter. (Add more food coloring if you want it darker. In this video,  I
  used 8 drops of McCormick liquid food coloring. Some brands are not as concentrated
  so you may need more or less)
- Pour batter evenly into the prepared pans.
- Bake for 20-22 minutes (may need longer) or until a toothpick inserted into the
  center comes out clean or with moist crumbs clinging to it.
- Place cakes on a cooling rack and when the pans are cool enough to touch, remove
  the cakes and allow them to finish cooling on the wire rack.

- LET'S MAKE THE FROSTING!
- To make the frosting, first follow the steps above to create the strawberry reduction,
  reducing it down to 1/4 cup this time. Set aside.
- In a large bowl, cream together butter, cream cheese, vanilla extract, and strawberry
  extract until combined. (Use a stand mixer if desired)
- Mix in salt and powdered sugar a little at a time, until creamy.
- Add in the strawberry puree by the tablespoon until desired firmness is reached.
  ( I use all 1/4 cup)
- Chill the frosting and then mix until fluffy before frosting the cakes. (Frosting
  should be extra airy and fluffy. See note.)
- Frost cake layers using an offset spatula. (This frosting is rich with bold strawberry
  flavor. A little goes a long way so so use thin layers of frosting between the cakes)
- Slice using a cake knife and serve. (Chill the cake if you wish to firm up the frosting
  before slicing)
- Store finished cake in the refrigerator and let come to room temperature before
  serving, for best results. (The strawberry flavor increases the next day so I usually
  make this cake the day before I want to serve it. Although it is still great the
  day of making it.)

- NOTES
- 'MEASURING FLOUR AND POWDERED SUGAR: First, fluff it with a spoon or sift. Spoon
  into measuring cup until overflowing. Tap the rim of the measuring cup to knock
  out any air bubbles. Level off the top with the back of a knife.'
- 'FROSTING:  Mix the frosting on high until it is super fluffy and airy. If the frosting
  is thick and heavy, it hasn''t been mixed enough. It will not look like enough frosting
  to frost the cakes but it will be! '
